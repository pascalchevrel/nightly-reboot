# nightly-reboot
Ideas to reboot the Firefox Nightly channel and use it to reboot our core technical communty

# tl;dr

We have lost momentum among geeks. That means less beta testing, patches to our products, website regression testing, bug triaging, technical localization and generally speaking lesser technical community participation. Our Firefox Nightly channel hasn't been promoted and we have lost 2/3 of our users there over the last 2 years, our Nightly users are also largely en-US users because we don't propose localized builds for download on our sites. I am proposing that we revive this channel and use the built in communication channels in Nightly to reboot our technical community. I am also proposing that we test the assumption that we can make Nightly a contribution funnel again on specific markets in Europe: France, Germany and Spain. We have all the tools needed to boost participation built in  Nightly (home page snippets, tiles, firstrun page, default bookmarks...) and we have local communities and regional offices that can assist us.
